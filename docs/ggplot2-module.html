<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This learning module will focus on the use of the <code>ggplot2</code> library with the help of a couple of its subsidiaries to create beautiful visualizations of your statistic test results. I will employ tidy syntax throughout the module, so if you are unfamiliar with the use of <code>dplyr</code> and the <code>magrittr</code> pipe, here are some resources that can help:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf">Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr Cheat sheet</a></p>
<p><a href="https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html">Pipe Operator</a></p>
<p>I will aim to be as transparent as possible with the code I demonstrate here, by utilizing three strategies that help viewers of my code understand what I am doing and why:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I’ll clarify my arguments within the code, although the code will run just fine without the extra statements. For example, I’ll type <code>ggplot(data = mydata)</code> rather than <code>ggplot(mydata)</code></p></li>
<li><p>I’ll use commented out annotations within the code chunks to explain in plain English what each line is doing. I’ll load my libraries in the following code chunk and use it as example of what I mean:</p></li>

<li>Finally, I will specify the package for functions that I use in my code using the double colons <code>::</code>, as in <code>readr::read_csv()</code>, so that you know where to find these functions later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Something else I want to add here for your benefit as potentially growing R users: This html document was created using an Rmarkdown script. I’ve been using Rmarkdown to create nice looking html documents for the better part of 2 years and I love it. While I was creating this module, however, a new publishing tool called Quarto became available via Rstudio; you will see it as a native document type under File &gt;&gt; New File as soon as you update your Rstudio version. QMD files will operate a lot like RMD files and can be used along with the rest of the Quarto tools to do all kinds of things like create books or websites. Check it out!</p>

<p>I’ll provide some suggested activities and explorations to help you gain the most from this module. Spend as long as you feel is helpful and interesting on these.</p>

<li><p>How is the method I used to load packages different from methods you might have used or seen previously? How might using this method change the way you have to code, and what are the benefits and drawbacks?</p></li>

<section id="ggplot-now-ggplot2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ggplot-now-ggplot2">ggplot (now ggplot2)</h2>
<p>In this learning module we will introduce basics of using the ggplot2 package and take a tour of a handful of useful plot types you will want to know how to create in order to represent statistical test results.</p>
<p><code>ggplot2</code> is a versatile and (usually) easy to use package for creating beautiful graphics from data in R. <code>ggplot2</code> takes data in the form of a data frame and creates a ggplot object, to which you can then add plot aesthetics. It is possible to make all kinds of custom adjustments in <code>ggplot2</code>, and to learn how to tweak your plots to suit your preferences I highly recommend checking out <a href="https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/UG/SM/STAT3022/r/current/Misc/data-visualization-2.1.pdf">the ggplot2 cheat sheet</a>. Do bear in mind when using <code>ggplot2</code> that there is a caveat to the simplicity of using such a streamlined set of functions to make otherwise complicated figures.<code>ggplot2</code> WILL make assumptions about things like the axis scales, inclusion of a legend, and colors to use, if you let it. These features are almost infinitely customize-able but once you start looking for ways to tweak your plots, you will find it helpful to know your way around help forums such as the ever-popular stack overflow, and the various R community resources.</p>
<p>I highly encourage anyone who will be creating plots to visualize data to visit <a href="https://ggplot2-book.org/introduction.html">The ggplot2 Book</a> and <a href="https://r-graphics.org/">The R Graphics Cookbook</a> for oodles of inspiration and advice.</p>
<p>The steps that go into creating a ggplot graphic can be broadly broken down into:</p>
<ul>
<li>creating the ggplot object and add aesthetics: this means declaring your variables of interest</li>
</ul>
<p><code>ggplot(data =        , mapping = aes(x =         , y =         ))</code></p>
<ul>
<li>add plot geom layers to your graphic</li>
</ul>
<p><code>geom_scatterplot()</code></p>
<ul>
<li>customize your plot by modifying themes, axes and labels</li>
</ul>
<p><code>theme_minimal()</code></p>
<p><code>labs(x = " ", y = " ", title = " ")</code></p>

<p>This dataset is useful for demonstrating a variety of common statistical tests that you might want to perform. Where these data do not have the characteristics I need to demonstrate a plot, I will instead use the R built in iris dataset, which contains measurements of width and length for petals and sepals for three different species of iris.</p>

<p>It is a nice feature of markdown that it outputs html documents which can be made interactive. The code below will print an interactive table of your data. While it is often not a good idea to burden your audience by printing your entire data to your output, there will be times where you might want to do this, and in those times, it might as well look good.</p>

<li><code>ggplot(data = kitsap, mapping = aes(DomVeg, SpRich)) + geom_bar()</code></li>

<h1>Chi Square Test</h1>
<p>Chi square tests compare expected vs observed outcomes in a population exposed to different treatments. Mosaic plots are a frequent go-to for displaying data being tested using chi square.</p>
<p>I’ll demonstrate two ways of building mosaic plots in <code>ggplot2</code>. They are both simple to use, and which one appeals to you will depend on your personal preferences for things like purpose-built vs versatile but possibly more code-heavy tools.</p>
<section id="mosaic-plots" class="level2">

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="with-geom_bar">With geom_bar()</h3>
<p>To create a plot of the proportions of various vegetation types at each site, ggplot will need something like an index column so that it has values to add to each of the categories in the stacked bar. The kitsap data has the RiverMeter column, which suits our purposes, but you could easily create a column to meet your needs with the following code:</p>
<p><code>as.numeric(rownames(your_data_frame))</code></p>

<h1>T-tests</h1>
<p>Displaying the results of a t-test requires highlighting the difference in means between two groups. You will want to display upper and lower quartiles in order to disclose what could otherwise be misleading differences in the range of the data. Outliers can be important too, remember to pay special attention to the Y axis range!</p>
<p>First, I’ll run the Welch’s two-sample t-test, so I know what to highlight in my plot.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="line-graphs">Line Graphs</h2>
<p>Making a line graph with a discrete x variable in ggplot2 required a bit of wrangling. The problem is that the <code>geom_pointrange()</code> function can take a numeric or string vector for the x variable, but creating a line between the two means becomes difficult unless the x variable is numeric. I get around that here by converting the binary LogJam variable from yes/no to 0/1, then change the labels back to yes/no once I’ve built the plot.</p>

<p>But, I have a problem with this. In this plot, it looks like groups have a real difference. That is because the actual range of the PerVeg variable is a lot larger than the range displayed on this graph; it is important to always pay attention to the assumptions that ggplot will make about how you want your data displayed, and I think that scales are an area of special concern since they can distort your findings. I’m going to create a second plot, altering the y axis so that it represents the full range of the data.</p>

<p>Heat maps can be helpful if you are trying to determine the degree or variety of correlations present in your data. This becomes more helpful as your data become larger and I find it works best to display 10-50 rows per heat map.</p>
<p>I am switching to using the built-in iris data here so that you can see how the color temperature works to display different correlations.</p>

<p>There’s another function that will give you correlations in addition to a lot of other output. It can be helpful if you are doing exploratory data analysis on a dataset with a few variables of interest where you are curious about the relationships between all or some of the variables. Run the <code>ggpairs()</code> function from the <code>GGally</code> package. Break up the data if you want to by using square brackets to cherry pick what columns you want to compare, as in <code>kitsap[ ,2:8]</code>. See what you can learn from the results.</p>
<p>Get started with this line of code: <code>GGally::ggpairs(kitsap)</code></p>

<p>The kitsap streams data does not have great variables for demonstrating a regression so I will default to using the built in iris data.</p>

<p>Add <code>color = Species</code> to the <code>aes()</code> arguments. What happens? What do you think now about the relationship between petal width and sepal length for iris?</p>
